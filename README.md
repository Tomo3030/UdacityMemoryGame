# Udacity Memory Game Project
### Notes 
- Made as part of Udacity's Front End Developers Nanodegree
- This is my first interactive project
- The code could be better

### How to Play 
- turn over a card 
- turn over another card
- hope that they match 
- if they don't try again

### How to win
- turn over all the cards 
- if you can win in less than 16 turns you get 3 stars
- if you win in less than 20 you get 2 stars
- if you win in less than 24 you get 1 star
- if you take more than 24 turns you get 0 stars 

### Easter Egg
if you really aren't good, you can cheat by looking in the javascript console.
